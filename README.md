# Rpgtables

This is intended as a prototype for a web application project. rpgtables allows
the user to create and roll on tables constructed out of various dice sizes. It
will also allow the user to chain tables together, so that the result of one
table can be used to influence how the next table is rolled upon. More examples
will be listed as development continues.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rpgtables'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rpgtables

## Usage

Currently in the initial stages of development. More to be added later.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
